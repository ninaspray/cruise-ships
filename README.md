Challenge ðŸš¢
This week you are going to be building and working with many objects that allow a cruise ship to operate. Hopefully we don't hit any icebergs on the way ðŸ‘€.

This is a 2 week project so please take time to understand the concepts.

DO:

Take time to read any recommended reading.
Try and give each step a go without the accompanying walkthrough.
Go over the walkthrough after (read it carefully).


Your challenge is to use domain modelling to translate the following user story into an object with properties and/or methods, to write any tests necessary for the user story, and to write the code that makes the test(s) pass. The user story is:

So I can get passengers aboard a ship,
I want a ship to have a starting port.
